# Business Structure
This file describes the components and their intent for each of the user types: User, Host, Admin.


## User
The `user` is the base user of the application who will be the consumer of both hosted sites and also this service.

### User-Dashboard
This is the landing page where the user will end up right after registering and where the application will take them right after the `user` is authenticated.



## Host
The `host` is a user of the application who will provide the sites that the user will rent, and also consume this site's services.



## Admin
The `admin` is a super user of the application.



## Account Manager
The `account manager` is not an existing role yet, but I do foresee that this role will be needed. The `account manager` will maintain the different host accounts and work to resolve any billing issues, disputes between `users` and `hosts`.
